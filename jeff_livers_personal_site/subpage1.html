            <h2>My Beginning</h2>

            <h2>College</h2>
            <p>I am getting my degree in Management Information systems with a minor in Sustainability. I love learning about how systems and processes operate and interact with one another. I think having this fundamental understanding helps understand how businesses and organizations operate on a larger scale. I find it very interesting learning different computer programs and softwares that are used to accomplish goals of teams and organizations. I also love learning about sustainability and how humans are impacting the environment. I love finding ways for these two seemingly separate fields can be used in unison to find better solutions to current environmental issues.
